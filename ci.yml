This YAML defines a continuous integration (CI) workflow for a Node.js application. The workflow is triggered whenever thereâ€™s a push or pull request to the main branch. It then sets up a job that runs on the latest Ubuntu environment and on three different versions of Node.js.

The job checks out your repository, sets up Node.js, installs dependencies, runs a build script (if present), and runs tests.
